# CalculatorWithC

This is my first project with .NET to practice developing desktop applications with c#. Application give avaibility to change some settings without modifying the code, for example When pressing the math operation button, the button changes the color and you can choose what color it to be from the application settings. Properties -> Settings. I have developed that project with OOP principles all of the calculator logic is separated in the calculator class and event handling logic is in form1.cs file.
